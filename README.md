Galton
======

This is a toy webapp written in Common Lisp and Javascript that
publishes a questionnaire, accepts submissions, and draws pretty graphs
summarising responses. Heavily inspired by Google Drive's forms.

Once you have [Quicklisp](http://quicklisp.org) setup, you can try
galton by cloning it onto `~/quicklisp/local-projects/` followed
by `(load "~/quicklisp/local-projects/galton/examples/questionnaire.lisp")`.

Tested with threaded SBCL 1.1.7 on OS X and ACL 9.0 SMP on Windows.
